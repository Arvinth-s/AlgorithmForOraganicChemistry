# OrganicCode
This program proves that organic chemistry can be comprehended easily without the need for accurate data(like electronegativity,...etc)
This program implements the concepts of various techniques like
1)sorting
2)searching
3)encoding & decoding
4)hash table
5)handling pointers and links between nodes

The program is capable of 
1)identifying compounds
2)assign its valency 
3)assign its oxidation state
4)can bond various atoms
5)update the oxidation state with respect to the bonded atom
6)Break existing bond and connect new bonds

Goals yet to implement
1)Graphic implementation of the same model
2)pi bond resonance
3)Stability of carbo cation by infering the inductive and mesomeric effect of the adjacent groups
4)Identification of most stable carbo cation and thus most active site of attack
