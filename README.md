# OrganicCode
This program proves that organic chemistry can be comprehended easily without the need for accurate data(like electronegativity,...etc)
This program implements the concepts of various techniques like
1)sorting
2)searching
3)encoding & decoding
4)hash table
5)handling pointers and links between nodes
6)File Handling in C++ and python
7)Graphic implementation of model


The program is capable of 
1)identifying compounds
2)assign its valency 
3)assign its oxidation state
4)can bond various atoms
5)update the oxidation state with respect to the bonded atom
6)Break existing bond and connect new bonds
7)pi bond resonance
8)Number of alpha H for the carbon
9)Break bond to provide unequal charge to the bonding atoms(i.e. negative charge to more electronegative atom and vice versa)
10)Form bond between adjacent atoms if
  1)either one contains charge and other contains pi bond
  2)both of them  contain opposite charges

Goals yet to implement
1)Stability of carbo cation by infering the inductive and mesomeric effect of the adjacent groups
2)Identification of most stable carbo cation and thus most active site of attack
3)Printing number of configurational isomers for any carbon chain
